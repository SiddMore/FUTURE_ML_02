📊 Customer Churn Prediction 🚀
📝 Project Overview
This project aims to predict Customer Churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer demographics and behavior, we identify those at risk of leaving, allowing businesses to take proactive retention measures.

This task was completed as part of the Future Interns machine learning internship.

🛠️ Key Features & Workflow
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and optimized data types.

EDA: Explored data distribution using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Feature Engineering: Applied LabelEncoder for categorical variables and StandardScaler for numerical scaling.

Modeling: Implemented multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and the high-performance XGBoost Classifier.

Evaluation: Evaluated performance using Confusion Matrices, ROC-AUC curves, and Classification Reports.

🗂️ Dataset
The model uses a Kaggle dataset containing customer information such as:

Geography & Gender 🌍

Credit Score & Balance 💰

Tenure & Number of Products 📅

Membership Status & Salary 💳

📈 Visualizing the Results
1. Confusion Matrix
Understanding the True Positives and False Positives to ensure model reliability.

2. Model Performance Comparison
Comparing XGBoost against other classifiers to find the best fit.

3. Feature Importance
Identifying which factors (like Age or Balance) contribute most to customer churn.
